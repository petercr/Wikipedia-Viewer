# Wikipedia-Viewer
This project allows you to search Wikipedia by inputting text and showing you the results of the search. It is one of the [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org) intermediate Front-End Challenges.

### Here is a list of the requirements that this project must fulfill

1.  I can search Wikipedia entries in a search box and see the resulting Wikipedia entries.

2.  I can click a button to see a random Wikipedia entry.

Thanks I hope you enjoy my creation. And feel free to reach out to me on Twitter
